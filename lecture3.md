## Visual cues

Visual cues are elements of a visualization that encode data. They are expressed as marks and channels:
- A .bold[mark] is a geometric primitive such as points, lines, or areas.
- A .bold[channel] is an attribute of a mark that can be used to encode data, such as position, size, shape, or color.

(a) Bar charts encode data using line marks, controlled by a vertical position channel (height) and a horizontal position channel (category).
(b) Scatterplots encode data using point marks, controlled by two position channels (x and y).
(c) A third variable can be encoded using a color channel.
(d) A fourth variable can be encoded using a size channel (area of the point).

## Perceptual hierarchy

Data can be encoded through a variety of visual channels. However, not all channels are equally effective for conveying information.

Cleveland and McGill (1984) conducted experiments to evaluate the accuracy of visual channels for encoding quantitative data.

## Coordinate systems

Before mapping (numerical) data to visual channels, it is important to choose an appropriate coordinate system as it affects the perception and effectiveness of the visualization.
- .bold[Cartesian coordinates]: intuitive and effective for most data types.
- .bold[Polar coordinates]: useful for cyclic data (e.g., time of day, seasons), but can distort perception of lengths.

## Scales and transformations

Sometimes, data spans several orders of magnitude or has a skewed distribution. In such cases, applying a transformation or using a different scale can improve the interpretability of the visualization.
- .bold[Linear scale]: preserves the original data values.
- .bold[Logarithmic scale]: useful for data spanning several orders of magnitude.
- .bold[Quantile scale]: divides data into equal-sized bins, useful for skewed distributions.

## Colors

Color is a powerful channel for encoding categorical and quantitative data.

The primary representation system is the Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) model:
- .bold[Hue]: the type of color (e.g., red, green, blue), numerically represented as an angle on the color wheel (0-360 degrees).
- .bold[Saturation]: the intensity or purity of the color (from gray to full color), represented as a percentage (0-100%).
- .bold[Value]: the brightness of the color (from black to full brightness), represented as a percentage (0-100%).

A colormap specifies a mapping between data values and colors. There are three main types of colormaps:
- .bold[Sequential colormaps]: vary smoothly from light to dark colors, often using a single hue; should be used for representing ordered data.
- .bold[Diverging colormaps]: vary smoothly between two different hues, with a neutral color in the middle; should be used for representing ordered data with a critical midpoint.
- .bold[Categorical colormaps]: consist of distinct colors; should be used for representing categorical data without inherent ordering.

Perceptually uniform colormaps ensure that equal steps in data are perceived as equal steps in color.

They should be preferred over non-uniform colormaps (jet, rainbow) that can mislead interpretation.

Finally, colors can also be used to .bold[draw attention] to specific elements in a visualization, such as highlighting important data points or trends.

## Key takeaways
- Visualize data using the most perceptually effective channels (positions, lengths)
- Use appropriate coordinate systems and scales to enhance interpretability.
- Choose colormaps that accurately represent the data and are accessible to all viewers.
- Avoid common pitfalls such as 3D effects, misleading axes, and unnecessary complexity.

## The bottom line

A good plot is one that effectively communicates the underlying data and insights to the audience. It should be clear, accurate, and visually appealing, while avoiding unnecessary complexity or distortion of the data.
